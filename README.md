# 🗑️ Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning

This project is a part of the AICTE + Shell + Edunet Foundation Internship (Cycle 1). It focuses on using **deep learning with transfer learning** to classify different types of garbage images into categories using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

We used a **pre-trained MobileNetV3Small** model with **data augmentation**, **fine-tuning**, and **custom layers** to build a garbage classifier.

### 🔍 Dataset
- Dataset used: [Trash Type Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farzadnekouei/trash-type-image-dataset)
- Contains multiple classes of garbage like:
  - Cardboard
  - Glass
  - Metal
  - Paper
  - Plastic
  - Trash
